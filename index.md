## Data Science

My most recent work is my final project for General Assembly's Data Science class:

__Bankruptcy Risk in the Polish Manufacturing Sector__

_To model bankruptcy risk and predict whether or not a company will go bankrupt based on a number of financial predictors such as profit, assets, and liabilities. The Altman Z-score is a comomon metric for predicting bankruptcy risk and generally works well as a predictor a year out from a bankruptcy event, but performs less well at longer time frames. This project aims to improve on the Altman Z-score, especially over longer times._
