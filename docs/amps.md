### About

We build custom amplifiers for hifi and guitar, using vacuum tubes (valves). All amplifiers are hand-wired using turret and eyelet boards. Most common audio tubes can be used however we are particularly fond of 6V6GT output tubes. Tubes choices are current production or new-old-stock (purchasers must provide own NOS tubes).

### Types

Almost any amplifier type can be made-to-order. We discuss the needs of the user and, in the case of guitar amplifiers, engage in an iterative process where we tailor the sound to suit the user. Amplifier can range from low-wattage single-ended amplifiers all the way to high-powered push-pull models suitable for the largest venues.

Models can be single or multiple channel and can incoporate any desired features like effects loops, reverb, and adjustable output power.

Cabinets are constructed using fine woods and finishes. Any type of wood can be specified. Options include finger and dove-tail joints.
